# Go Cheat Sheet
Updating module dependencies: `go mod tidy`

Running the app without building: `go run .`

Running test cases: `go test .`

Build an executable: `go build -v -o build/`
> Note the `-o build/` ensures the executable is built in a new `build/` directory rather than the source directory.
